Hi Yuval.
I found you from Codementor.
If you don't use the codementor, I'd like to borrow.
Because my account was disabled.
I tried many times to create a new one. but every time it failed
So I decided it would be better to use what existed than to create something new.
I will pay you monthly. I think we can negotiate the price well.
